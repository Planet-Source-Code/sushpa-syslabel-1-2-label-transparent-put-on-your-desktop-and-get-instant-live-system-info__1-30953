## SysLabel 1\.2: Label \[transparent\] put on your desktop and get instant, live system info, uptime\.\.\.


</div>

### Description

This is a label resembling LiteStep's labels. It stays on the desktop and shows system information such as

memory usage, CPU usage, Time/Date/Uptime (with user-defined formatting), Active window and Active

task, Multiline text, Computer name, Windows version, Processor type, etc. Full support for displaying as

many images as you like within the label (e.g. icons). FULLY TRANSPARENT, if you like; or can be made to

display a custom BackImage. Supports multiple profiles, so you can load more than one label with different

info displayed on each. Shows CPU Usage as graphical progress bar as well. User-specified co-ordinates &

size, image co-ordinates for each image, and co-ordinates for the CPU graph. (The included screenshot is

within LiteStep, but SysLabel looks the same under a regular Windows shell as well).
