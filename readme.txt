SysLabel 1.2: Label [transparent] put on your desktop and get instant, live system info, uptime...

This is a label resembling LiteStep's labels. It stays on the desktop and shows system information such as
memory usage, CPU usage, Time/Date/Uptime (with user-defined formatting), Active window and Active
task, Multiline text, Computer name, Windows version, Processor type, etc. Full support for displaying as 
many images as you like within the label (e.g. icons). FULLY TRANSPARENT, if you like; or can be made to 
display a custom BackImage. Supports multiple profiles, so you can load more than one label with different 
info displayed on each. Shows CPU Usage as graphical progress bar as well. User-specified co-ordinates &
size, image co-ordinates for each image, and co-ordinates for the CPU graph. (The included screenshot is
within LiteStep, but SysLabel looks the same under a regular Windows shell as well).
